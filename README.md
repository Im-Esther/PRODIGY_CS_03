This third task at Prodigy Infotech involves creating a Password Strength Assessment Tool.This is tool is designed to provide a basic assessment of password strength.

After running this code, you will be prompted to enter a password. The tool will then assess the strength of the password based on the following criteria:
- Length (minimum 8 characters)
- Presence of uppercase letters (A-Z)
- Presence of lowercase letters (a-z)
- Presence of numbers (0-9)
- Presence of special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)

Based on these criteria, the tool will categorize the password strength as either weak,medium,strong or very strong

The tool will then provide feedback on the password strength, indicating whether it meets the recommended standards.
